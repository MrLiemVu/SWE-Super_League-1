# Software Engineering Super League 1 (SES1) by Lighthall

### Summary:
The Software Engineering Super League is a SWE competition based on web development. Prior to entering this competition, I had no experience in building websites. However, throughout this time I learned a variety of web development technologies and implemented them to advance through the final stage of the competition and finish in top 50 out of 1600 competitors.

### Description of the competition:
The Lighthall Software Engineering Super League (SESL1) is a multi-level project-based competition, where you can tackle engineering challenges to build your portfolio of projects and gain experience working in teams, while qualifying for job opportunities.

HOW DOES THE SUPER LEAGUE WORK?

The Software Engineering Super League has 5 levels of engineering challenges - 2 individual challenges and 3 team challenges. Challenges will be launched on Mondays and submissions are due on Fridays.

With each level, the projects get more challenging. You will have access to mentors and support at each stage, but it won't be easy to make it as a finalist to the 5th level.

Please note that none of the challenges are in any way related to Lighthall's product. All projects will be your intellectual property, which you can add to your portfolio and present to any company when recruiting.

1. LEVEL 1 CHALLENGE

Chasing the Clicks

Build a web page (or any kind of hosted web app) with a clickable button and a click count. Every time that the button is clicked, the number increases by 1. When the web page is refreshed, the click count number should reflect all previous clicks. That means, refreshing the page should not reset the count to 0 or any other default number.

You can earn bonus points for showing on the web page the distribution of clicks by geography. This could be a simple table, a map or any other way that you can think of.

2. LEVEL 2 CHALLENGE

Get Organized with a Task Tracker App

For this challenge, you are going to build a task tracker app. Your minimum requirements are:


1) Create a task with a title, description, status (completed, in progress, etc.), and due date

2) Edit and delete Tasks

3) View all tasks, and sort by title, status, and due date

4) Users can log in by entering their name and will only see their tasks. That means, I should be able to enter “Maya”, add tasks for Maya and only see Maya’s tasks when I enter that name, whenever I visit the Task Tracker App


As a user, I should be able to access my tasks from any device – that means, the data needs to be stored server-side.

2. LEVEL 3 CHALLENGE

Hangman

The Level 3 challenge will be more “playful” than in previous challenges: build a game of Hangman. For reference, here is the Wikipedia article that explains how the game works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)

For this project, we want you to:

1. Design a gameplay where the player can play against the computer with a random set of words

2. Display a leaderboard (stored on server side)

3. Ability for the user to set the word for a single session and give the link to somebody else to play it
